# Angular Three.js Cube Viewer

This Angular application integrates Three.js to create a dynamic 3D cube that can be controlled through various user inputs. Users can interactively adjust the camera position, change the rotation speed of the cube, and upload custom textures to apply to the cube's surface.

## Features

- **3D Cube Rendering**: The app uses Three.js to render a 3D cube within the Angular framework.
- **Dynamic Camera Positioning**: Users can change the camera's Z position to zoom in or out on the cube.
- **Adjustable Rotation Speeds**: Users can control the rotation speed of the cube along the X and Y axes.
- **Custom Texture Upload**: Users can upload an image file to use as the texture on the cube.

## Technologies Used

- **Angular**: Front-end framework used for building the application.
- **Three.js**: JavaScript 3D library used to create and render the 3D cube.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript used for type-safe coding.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
